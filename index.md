# 5th IEEE Workshop on Visualization Guidelines in Research, Design, and Education

Workshop at [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/year/2022/welcome), October 17, Oklahoma City, USA

Deadline for submissions: June 28th (midnight, Anywhere on Earth)

Check the schedule [soon]

## About
The VisGuides 2024 Workshop focuses on the analysis, design, reflection, and discussion of applicable frameworks to mastering guidelines in visualization by the broader visualization community, embedded in a larger research agenda of visualization theory and practices. It follows up the ideas from the IEEE VIS 2016, [2018](https://c4pgv.dbvis.de/), [2020](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/c4pgv/) Workshop on Creation, Curation, Critique and Conditioning of Principles and Guidelines in Visualization (C4PGV).

The workshop also features an open call for being part of the program committee (PC) to provide an opportunity to advocate for guidelines on a broad range of topics. If you want to get involved, contact diehl (at) ifi.uzh.ch.


### Topics and Scope

The IEEE VIS VisGuides workshop is a forum for constructive discussions around guidelines in visualization and how the visualization researchers and creators disseminate and discuss their designs. The understanding and operationalization of guidelines is important not only for academics, but also for practitioners alike, who are tasked to make design trade-offs, problem-solving, and justify decisions. Moreover, guidelines are essential for teaching and learning about visualization. Questions this workshop wants to discuss include:

- What visualization guidelines exist and how do we (as a scientific community) collect and disseminate them?

- How do we apply and discuss guidelines in daily-work practice, in design, in advising, and in teaching?

- What is the role of visualization knowledge and guidelines in the wild, i.e., outside the scientific community?

- How to scrutinize empirical knowledge and make a discussion around guidelines public?

- What are types of guidelines, guidance, and how do we formalize visualization knowledge?

- How can we systematize, rank and categorize guidelines in the wild?

### Goals

- Illustrate the use of best practices and guidelines in the wild as seen from the VIS community and practitioners through discussions among the presenters and the audience.Collecting, reflecting, and discussing a survey of well-known guidelines from the presenters and the audience through interactive activities, examples, and submissions

- Constructing an open and democratic discussion about principles, guidelines, and recommendations, based on the presented evidence (including examples of their uses and misuses), critique (including revision and improvement), and conditioning (i.e., education, training, and deployment), compiling the lessons learned from the usage of those guidelines

- Discussing ideas and proposals of feasible approaches towards formalizing visualization guidelines with an impact beyond the scientific visualization community. This is an important point as more and more visualization designs are created outside the scientific community, and the community must reinforce the efforts to publicize their study results

- To raise questions about the ethical, practical, and technical implications of establishing guidelines for visualization; Broadening the discussion of guidelines to applications and educational contexts

## Submissions

Submit your work and ideas as either a short paper (4-6 pager) discussing guidelines in the wild, applications in design practice, and limitations. Become part of a vibrant half-day workshop that will bring together an exciting program with papers and discussions on the future of guidelines in visualization.
